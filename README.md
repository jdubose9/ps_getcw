# ps_getcw
ps_getCW are 3 powershell functions used to retieve a ticket from Connectwise and then push into (specifically) VictorOps. This is mostly modified from https://github.com/hematic/ with specific functions to pull new tickets. 

Although the Get-CWKeys function is included, it's recommended you hardcode your API keys so you don't hit the limit for available keys in Connectwise. 

The code is sloppy and pretty rudimetric. More of a working concept than anything else.
